8.1 Triple Step: A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3
steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the
stairs.





def count_ways(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    dp=[0]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for i in range(3,n+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 3] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 1]
    return dp[n]
